Parts of a DataFrame
To better understand DataFrame objects, it's useful to know that they consist of three components, stored as attributes:

.values: A two-dimensional NumPy array of values.
.columns: An index of columns: the column names.
.index: An index for the rows: either row numbers or row names.
You can usually think of indexes as being like a list of strings or numbers, though the pandas Index data type allows for more sophisticated options. (These will be covered later in the course.)
